Snake 2D

Description:
A simple 2D Snake game coded in Java.

What I Learned:
- The use of classes to divide the game window into a grid and control movement within.

Future Improvements:
- Introduce images or animations instead of fill3DRect().
- Add reset and pause button.
- User-controlled difficulty with varying types of food/poison. Bonuses and penalties apply.
